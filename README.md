# data-warehouse-analyst-sql-project
This project show my ability to work with a multi-table dataset, analyze data using SQL, build a small SQLite data warehouse, and show some Tableau skills. The scenario simulates a real medical study tracking screening, eligibility, withdrawals, and enrollment readiness of dog participants.

The repository includes:
-The original dataset (`DataWarehouseAnalyst_Dataset.xlsx`)
-SQL queries with explanations (`dog study queries.sql`)
-My working SQLite session (`dog_study.sqbpro`)
-Organized SQL answers exported in CSV files
-A SQLite database (`dog_study.db`)
-Tableau dashboard (`Enrollment Dashboard.twbx`) and screenshots in PDF format
