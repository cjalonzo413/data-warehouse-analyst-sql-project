# data-warehouse-analyst-sql-project
This project show my ability to work with a multi-table dataset, analyze data using SQL, build a small SQLite data warehouse, and show some Tableau skills. The scenario simulates a real medical study tracking screening, eligibility, withdrawals, and enrollment readiness of dog participants.

The repository includes:
- A SQLite database (`dog_study.db`)
- SQL queries with explanations
- The original dataset (`DataWarehouseAnalyst_Dataset.xlsx`)
- My working session (`dog_study.sqbpro`)
- Tableau dashboard (`Enrollment Dashboard.twbx`) and screenshots
